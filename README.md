# Microsoft Copilot Studio ❤️ MCP

Welcome to the **Microsoft Copilot Studio ❤️ MCP** lab. In this lab, you will learn how to deploy an MCP Server, and how to add it to Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## ❓ What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, defined by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/). MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. MCP allows makers to seamlessly integrate existing knowledge servers and APIs directly into Copilot Studio.

Currently, Copilot Studio only supports Tools. To learn more about current capabilities, see [aka.ms/mcsmcp](https://aka.ms/mcsmcp). There are some known issues & planned improvements. These are listed [here](#known-issues-and-planned-improvements).

## 🆚 MCP vs Connectors

When do you use MCP? And when do you use connectors? Will MCP replace connectors?

MCP servers are made available to Copilot Studio using connector infrastructure, so these questions are not really applicable. The fact that MCP servers use the connector infrastructure means they can employ enterprise security and governance controls such as [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/vnet-support-overview) integration, [Data Loss Prevention](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention) controls, [multiple authentication methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/#2-secure-your-api)—all of which are available in this release—while supporting real-time data access for AI-powered agents.

So, MCP and connectors are really **better together**.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

## 🎓 Lab

To be able to deploy this MCP Server and use it in Microsoft Copilot Studio, you need to go through the following actions:

- [Create a new GitHub repository based on the template](#create-a-new-github-repository-based-on-the-template)
- [Run the MCP Server locally](#run-the-mcp-server-locally)
- [Create the Power Platform Connector](#create-the-power-platform-connector)
- [Add the MCP Server as an action in Microsoft Copilot Studio](#add-the-mcp-server-as-an-action-in-microsoft-copilot-studio)

### ➕ Create a new GitHub repository based on the template

1. Select `Use this template`
1. Select `Create a new repository

    ![](./assets/usetemplate.png)

1. Select the right `Owner` (it might already be selected when you have only one owner to choose from)
1. Give it a `Repository name`
1. Optionally you can give it a `Description`
1. Select `Private`
1. Select `Create repository`

    This will take a little while. After it's done, you will be directed to the newly created repository.

> [!WARNING]  
> After completing the steps in this lab, you will have an MCP Server running on Azure that is publicly available. Ideally, you don't want that. Make sure to run `azd down` after finishing the lab to delete all the resources from your Azure subscription.

### 🏃‍♀️ Run the MCP Server Locally

1. Clone this repository
1. Open Visual Studio Code and open the sample folder
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the sample folder
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run build && npm run start`

    ![Terminal view after building and starting the server](./assets/vscode-terminal-run-start.png)

1. Select `PORTS` at the top of the Visual Studio Code Terminal

    ![Image of VS Code where the terminal is open and the PORTS tab is highlighted](./assets/vscode-terminal-ports.png)

1. Select the green `Forward a Port` button

    ![Image of VS Code where the PORTS tab is open and the green `Forward a Port` button is highlighted](./assets/vscode-terminal-ports-forward.png)

1. Enter `3000` as the port number (this should be the same as the port number you see when you ran the command in step 5). You might be prompted to sign in to GitHub, if so please do this, since this is required to use the port forwarding feature.
1. Right click on the row you just added and select `Port visibility` > `Public` to make the server publicly available
1. Ctrl + click on the `Forwarded address`, which should be something like: `https://something-3000.something.devtunnels.ms`
1. Select `Copy` on the following pop-up to copy the URL

    ![View of the PORTS setup with highlighted the port, the forwarded address and the visibility](./assets/vscode-terminal-ports-setup.png) 

1. Open to the browser of your choice and paste the URL in the address bar, type `/mcp` behind it and hit enter

If all went well, you will see the following error message:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Method not allowed."},"id":null}
```

Don't worry - this error message is nothing to be worried about!

## 🌎 Host on Azure Container Apps

Make sure to login to Azure Developer CLI if you haven't done that yet.

```azurecli
azd auth login
```

Run the following command in the terminal:

```azurecli
azd up
```

After running the `azd up` command, it will take a couple of minutes before the server has been deployed. When it's done - you should be able to go to the URL that's listed at the end and add `/mcp` to the end of that URL. 

![Azd deploy server output](./assets/azd-deploy-server.png)

You should again see the following error:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Method not allowed."},"id":null}
```

## 👨‍💻 Use the Jokes MCP Server in Visual Studio Code / GitHub Copilot

To use the Jokes MCP Server, you need to use the URL of your server (can be either your devtunnel URL or your deployed Azure Container App) with the `/mcp` part at the end and add it as an MCP Server in Visual Studio Code.

1. Press either `ctrl` + `shift` + `P` (Windows/Linux) or `cmd` + `shift` + `P` (Mac) and type `MCP`
1. Select `MCP: Add Server...`
1. Select `HTTP (HTTP or Server-Sent Events)`
1. Paste the URL of your server in the input box (make sure `/mcp` in the end is included)
1. Press `Enter`
1. Enter a name for the server, for instance `JokesMCP`
1. Select `User Settings` to save the MCP Server settings in your user settings
1. Open `GitHub Copilot`
1. Switch from `Ask` to `Agent`
1. Make sure the `JokesMCP` server actions are enabled
1. Ask the following question:

    ```text
    Get a chuck norris joke from the Dev category
    ```

This should give you a response like this:

![Screenshot of question to provide a joke from the dev category and the answer from GitHub Copilot](./assets/github-copilot-get-joke.png)

Now you have added the `JokesMCP` server to Visual Studio Code!

    ```

1. Add the following `Instructions`

    ```text
    You are a joke-telling assistant. Your sole purpose is to deliver appropriate, clever, and engaging jokes upon request. Follow these rules:
    
    * Respond only when the user asks for a joke or something related (e.g., "Tell me something funny").
    * Match the tone and humor preference of the user based on their input—clean, dark, dry, pun-based, dad jokes, etc.
    * Never break character or provide information unrelated to humor.
    * Keep jokes concise and clearly formatted.
    * Avoid offensive, discriminatory, or NSFW content.
    * When unsure about humor preference, default to a clever and universally appropriate joke.
    * Do not repeat jokes within the same session.
    * Avoid explaining the joke unless explicitly asked.
    * Be responsive, witty, and quick.
    ```

1. Select `Create` on the top right

    ![Create agent](./assets/createagent.png)

1. Enable Generative AI `Orchestration`

    ![Turn on orchestration](./assets/turnonorchestration.png)

    ![Turn off general knowledge](./assets/turnoffgeneralknowledge.png)

1. Select `Actions` in the top menu
 
    ![Actions](./assets/actions.png)

1. Select `Add an action`

    ![Add an action](./assets/addanaction.png)

1. Search for the name (in this case, `jokes`) of the connector you created [earlier](#create-the-power-platform-connector) (see number 1 in the screenshot below)
1. Select the `Jokes MCP server` (see number 2 in the screenshot below)

    ![Search for and select the action](./assets/addaction.png)

1. Wait for the connection to be created and select `Next` when it's done

    ![Action and connection](./assets/actionconnection.png)

1. Change the `Description for the agent to know when to use this action` to the following text:

    ```text
    Trigger this action when a user asks for a joke. It can provide Chuck Norris jokes, Dad jokes and Yo Mama jokes.
    ```
  
    Leave the rest as default, like for instance end user authentication, where you will learn more about in a minute.

1. Select `Add action` to add the action to the agent

    ![Add action](./assets/addactionend.png)

1. Select the `refresh icon` in the `Test your agent` pane

    ![Refresh testing pane](./assets/refreshtestingpane.png)

1. In the `Test your agent` pane send the following message:

    ```text
    Can I get a Chuck Norris joke?
    ```
  
    This will show you message that additional permissions are required to run this action. This is because of the user authentication in the action wizard.

1. Select `Connect`

    ![Additional permissions](./assets/additionalpermissions.png)
  
    This will open a new window where you can manage your connections for this agent.

1. Select `Connect` next to the `JokesMCP`

    ![Connect to JokesMCP](./assets/connect.png)

1. Wait until the connection is created and select `Submit`

    ![Pick a connection](./assets/submitconnection.png)

1. The connection should now be connected, so the status should be set to `Connected`

    ![Status connected](./assets/connected.png) 

1. Close the manage your connections tab in your browser

    Now you should be back in the Jokester agent screen.

1. Select the `refresh icon` in the `Test your agent` pane

    ![Refresh testing pane](./assets/refreshtestingpane.png)

1. In the `Test your agent` pane send the following message:

    ```text
    Can I get a Chuck Norris joke?
    ```

    This will now show a Chuck Norris joke - instead of the additional permissions.

    ![Chuck Norris joke](./assets/chucknorrisjoke.png)

1. In the `Test your agent` pane send the following message:

    ```text
    Can I get a Dad joke?
    ```

    This will now show a Dad joke.

    ![Dad joke](./assets/dadjoke.png)
